# self-powered-vehicle

## Mission
You have been hired by a children's aid society to put together a self-powered vehicle from used or easy to find parts that can be found anywhere in the world. They want to see a prototype and they want to make sure it will travel at least 2 meters. Once your project is complete they will give your product to less fortunate children.  Ideally your product will be easy to fix - so they can build and repair their own toys and develop some engineering skills in the process.

## Technologies to Learn / Practice
* **Stored Engineering** - how to store energy that can be used later
* **Dynamic Engineering** - how to convert energy into movement
* **Dynamics** - how the vehicle platform (structure) can easily move through air (or water) -- allowing the system to convert most of its stored engery into movement
* **Low Friction Joints** - how to ensure the vehicle's moving parts move freely and easily to convert most of its stored engery into movement
* **Kanban Workflow** -- organize and track ones project progress independently and when asking for help others understand the starting point
* **Incremental Work** -- work in small adjustable units to build a project
* **Web Communication** -- communicating and web technologies

## Tasks

#### Research Self-Powered Toy Vehicles
At the end of this stage you should be able to sketch your idea and have ideas noted that won't be used (please use your idea books).

1. Research 3 ways to create a vehicle platform *(plastic bottle, popsicle sticks, etc.)* - save links / document your findings
2. Research 3 ways to have a self-powered mechanism *(fan, ballon, etc.)* - save links / document your findings
3. Choose a vehicle platform
4. Choose a power mechanism
5. draw a rough sketch of your product (find a place to include your organization logo)
6. show sketch to another group

#### Build the Vehicle Platform
It should move (roll, float, fly) freely at least two meters after a light push

1. fghjk

#### Build on Self-Powered Movement
At the end of this phase your vehicle should roll freely at least two meters without any human energy input (no push allowed).

1. dfghj

#### Demo to another group
1. Demo to another group(s) of students
2. Adopt at least one idea (and credit it blog).

#### Create a Product webpage (in your Organization website)

#### Create a Product blog (in your Organization website)

#### Present to Angle Investors
