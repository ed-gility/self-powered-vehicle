# self-powered-vehicle

## Mission
You have been hired by a children's aid society to put together a self-powered vehicle from used or easy to find parts that can be found anywhere in the world. They want to see a prototype and they want to make sure it will travel at least 2 meters and *carries a seated lego person passenger*. Once your project is complete they will give your product to less fortunate children.  Ideally your product will be easy to fix - so they can build and repair their own toys and develop some engineering skills in the process.

## Technologies to Learn / Practice
* **Stored Engineering** - how to store energy that can be used later
* **Dynamic Engineering** - how to convert energy into movement
* **Dynamics** - how the vehicle platform (structure) can easily move through air (or water) -- allowing the system to convert most of its stored engery into movement
* **Low Friction Joints** - how to ensure the vehicle's moving parts move freely and easily to convert most of its stored engery into movement
* **Kanban Workflow** -- organize and track ones project progress independently and when asking for help others understand the starting point
* **Incremental Work** -- work in small adjustable units to build a project
* **Web Communication** -- communicating and web technologies

## Tasks

### Create a Kanban
* **Skip this you already have a Kanban folder**
 1. Get a Folder
 2. Put your Organization Name on the Cover
 3. Inside the folder make 6 columns **(Backlog, Next, Doing, Demo, Angles, Done)**
  
* **DO FOR EVERY PROJECT**
 4. Create a post-it for each major area
 5. Put tasks to cross off on each post-it
 6. Put tasks into backlog (except **Create Kanban** - *doing* & **Research** - *next*)

*(**If unsure - see the classroom example**)*

### Research Self-Powered Toy Vehicles
At the end of this stage you should be able to sketch your idea and have ideas noted that won't be used (please use your idea books).

1. Research 3 ways to create a vehicle platform *(plastic bottle, popsicle sticks, etc.)* - save links / document your findings
2. Research 3 ways to have a self-powered mechanism *(fan, ballon, etc.)* - save links / document your findings
3. Choose a vehicle platform
4. Choose a power mechanism
5. draw a rough sketch of your product (find a place to include your organization logo)
6. show sketch to another group

### Build the Vehicle Platform
It should move (roll, float, fly) freely at least two meters after a light push

1. Create the Chassis *(front, rear, seating for Lego person & windshield)*.
2. Create the axels and wheels (assuming a rolling ground vehicle) -- *balast and keel for boats, wings and tail for fligth, etc.*
3. Attach wheels (or the guidance system, keel, wings, etc)
4. **Test** - Be sure the system glides two meters given only minimal thrust.
5. **Demo** to other groups and get ideas for adjustments

### Build on Self-Powered Movement
At the end of this phase your vehicle should roll freely at least two meters without any human energy input (no push allowed).

1. build propulsion system - Fan, Propellor, etc
2. build energy transfer system - rubberband power, batter/motor, etc.
3. Assemble and test that propulsion system delivers energy (including in the correct direction)
4. Attach propulsion to vehicle & TEST
5. **Demo** to other groups and get ideas for adjustments

### Create a Product webpage (in your Organization website)
1. copy the file **self-powered-vehicle.html** into your Organization's website
2. attach a photo or video of your projects
3. give a description of your project
4. link this new webpage into your **Products** section of your organiation's homepage **index.html**
5. **Demo** this product page to other groups and get ideas for adjustments

### Create a Product blog (in your Organization website)
1. copy the file **self-powered-vehicle-blog.html** into your organization's website
2. write the **Product Fit** description
3. Write the **Acknowledge** section to honor those who helped you
4. Write the **Ideas to go further** section
5. Write the **Technologies Learned** section
6. Link this new blog to the **Blog** section of your organiation's homepage **index.html**
7. **Demo** this product page to other groups and get ideas for adjustments
